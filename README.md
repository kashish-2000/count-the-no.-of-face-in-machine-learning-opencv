# count-the-no.-of-face-in-machine-learning-opencv
Count Faces in an Image  In this example, we will be counting no. of faces in an image using OpenCV.   1.Importing Library Firstly we will import the opencv library.   2.Loading Pre-trained Model The faceCascade will load the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file using the Cascade Classifiers. They are trained with several hundred "positive" sample views of a particular object and arbitrary1 "negative" images of the same size. After the classifier is trained it can be applied to a region of an image and detect the object in question.   The haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml is a pre-trained model, using which we can detect faces.  Then image is read using cv2.imread() 3.Detecting faces After that we will detect the faces using the loaded model in faceCascade.   In detectMultiScale, the first parameter passed is the image name.  The second parameter passed is the scale factor, which is a parameter specifying how much the image size is reduced at each image scale.  The minNeighbors, specifies how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it.  minSize is the minimum possible object size. Objects smaller than that are ignored
